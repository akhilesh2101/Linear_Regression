# Linear_Regression
A deep dive into linear regression using R

Introduction
Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If administrators could determine the factors that influence increases in the percentage of alumni who donate, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased revenues.
A study shows that students who have more access to the faculty are more likely to be satisfied. As a result, one might suspect that smaller class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn might lead to an increase in the percentage of alumni who donate.
In this project, we will develop a linear regression model to study the factors affecting alumni donation in schools.
Data
The data set comes from the 2006 ASA Data Expo and contains data for 48 national universities (Americaâ€™s Best Colleges, Year 2000 Edition).
